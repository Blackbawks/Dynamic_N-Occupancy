# Dynamic_N-Occupancy

We introduce a new model (“dynamic N-occupancy”) capable of providing accurate estimates of local abundance, population gains (reproduction/immigration), and apparent survival probabilities while accounting for imperfect detection using only detection/nondetection data.

In this repo you will find full R code for the simulation study as well as the full results file. We also provide model code for the barred owl case study.
